# Interesting CTF Challs
This repo is my collection of challenges which I find interesting. These challenges have taught me new Web-exploitation techniques and concepts. I plan on making a write-up of my own for each challenge. It's meant for personal benefit, but I'd be happy if others can benefit from it too.
